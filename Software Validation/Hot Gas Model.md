# Hot Gas Model Validation
PyRegen employs a Bartz type correlation with radiative heat transfer for the modelling of hot gases around the chamber walls.
In the paper linked below you can find graphs of the convective heat transfer coefficient (hc) detailed for multiple cases, varying chamber pressure (Pc) and mixture ratio (MR), and comparisons with CFD results.
