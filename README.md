## Confusing Parts
This sections details how you should fill the channel geometry entries, especially the location related ones.

The third entry -- Step End (Distance from IP) -- refers to the red distance on the first image.
Note : The "Step End" means the ending location of the step IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COOLANT FLOW (distance from Injector Plate). For example, if the coolant flow would be reversed in the first image, "Step End" would be towards the nozzle exit, and the distance for the entry would be taken as such.
